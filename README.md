## Simple Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python script provides a simple method to encrypt and decrypt messages using a substitution cipher. The script generates a random key to substitute each character from the original message with a different character from a predefined set of characters.

### Features

- Encrypt a message by substituting each character with a randomly shuffled character.
- Decrypt the encrypted message back to its original form.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required; the script uses built-in libraries only.

### How It Works

1. **Character Set**: The script uses a character set that includes spaces, punctuation, digits, and all uppercase and lowercase letters.
2. **Key Generation**: A random key is generated by shuffling the character set.
3. **Encryption**: Each character from the original message is replaced by its corresponding character from the shuffled key.
4. **Decryption**: Each character from the encrypted message is replaced back using the original character set.

### Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Python environment.
2. **Input Message for Encryption**: When prompted, enter the message you want to encrypt.
3. **View Encrypted Message**: The script will display the encrypted version of your message.
4. **Input Encrypted Message for Decryption**: Enter the encrypted message when prompted to retrieve the original message.
5. **View Original Message**: The script will display the original message.

### Important Notes

- The encryption method is basic and not suitable for secure communication. It is meant for educational purposes.
- Each execution of the script generates a new key, meaning the same plaintext will produce different ciphertexts each time.
